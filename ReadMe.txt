Name: FedEx Hub Cargo Final Weight

Purpose: FedEx Material Handlers (my current job) are tasked with weighing containers and computing the final weight that makes it onto the plane.
We must remove the dolly weight and sometimes remove the container weight for Bulk loads. While the calculation is simple, Material Handlers are often rushing,
and any miscalculation can be life threatening to the pilots. Also, Material Handlers often miss-type the numbers that they’re inputting so I would like the
program to double check that as well. For example, a dolly weight could be 1000lbs, but a handler may input 100lbs and not get any pushback from our current system.  

Reason: I am creating this program because it relates to my current job. While I may not be able to use it for work, I want to create a program that has real-world applications that I can understand and verify.

Goals: I want this application to ask the user to input total weight, input dolly weight, ask if it’s a bulk load, if it is a bulk load ask the user to input container
weight, calculate the final weight by subtracting the other necessary weights, and verify that the weights being entered make sense.

Audience: My target audience is Material Handlers working for FedEx Hub. From what I’ve seen their ages vary from 18 to 40. Material Handlers are male and female but
I’ve seen more males. Generally speaking, these people are either high school graduates or are in college, the vast majority works night-shift, and they often work
at another job before or after working at FedEx.
